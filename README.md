# React Notes

A site that, like a Google document, allows contributors to create and store notes.

## What Worked Well
- getting the core features to work
- setting up functions to interact with firebase

## What Didn't
- had some difficulties understanding the flow of components and how react operated
- understanding the workings of the Immutable Map
- undos for one step in the text

## Extra Credit
- extra styles, with hover effects, and button hovers
- brings selected note forward with modified z-index
